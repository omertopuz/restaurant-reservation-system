# A web-based restaurant reservation system

## Requirements

The system needs to support the following flow:
- User navigates to the website via desktop web-browser
    - Although other platforms such as mobile may be targeted down the road, they aren't a requirement for MVP.
- Selects restaurant, date and approximate time, and party size
    - For example, I'd like a table for four at Toast Grill and Tap around 6pm today.
- The website displays the list of available slots
    - For example, there's a table at 6, 6:30, and 7:30.
- User picks and books a slot
